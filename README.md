**Context**

I recently obtained a grant for 2 years to investigate the neural mechanisms that lead to the belief that something is real or not (like fake news) and investigate possible ways of modulating this belief (by manipulating the external and internal context, and stimulating the brain).

We plan to run several experiments including techniques like EEG, bodily signals, and possibly neurofeedback and brain stimulation (TDCs) with different populations (healthy young adults, older adults and psychiatric patients).


**How to apply**:

- [ ] Drop me an **email** (with a **CV**) in which you tell us why you're the best candidate for the job. You can mention whom you've work with (as reference contacts), but focus on what you actually did, learned, what you liked and didn't like, and what you want to learn and do in the future. Don't bother with reference letters or transcripts.

- [ ] **Challenge**: If you want, you can try and do the ["make sense out of some data" challenge](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/jobs/tree/master/challenge) (you can attach your report alongside your CV in the email). Remember, it's not about getting the right answer, but rather about trying and thinking.
